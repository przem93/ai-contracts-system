# üß© AI Contracts System

## üß† Overview
**AI Contracts System** is a backend‚Äìfrontend platform that manages and visualizes **technical dependency contracts** across an application ecosystem.  
It ingests **YAML contract files** ‚Äî delivered from external repositories or services ‚Äî and uses them to represent the **real-world structure and relationships** between modules, APIs, and even React components.

The system transforms these YAML contracts into a **graph representation** stored in a Neo4j database, making it possible to explore, validate, and reason about dependencies programmatically or through a UI.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

- **External YAML ingestion**  
  The system accepts YAML files provided from outside sources (e.g. other repos or CI pipelines).

- **Real-state reflection**  
  Each YAML file describes the **actual current structure** of a project ‚Äî its modules, components, and interdependencies.

- **Configurable sources**  
  YAML file locations are defined via an `.env` variable, e.g.:
  ```bash
  CONTRACTS_PATH=/contracts/**/*.yml
```
